    Sophie: I'm p-pregnant, Colin.
    Colin: Oh, wow.
    Sophie: And I just want to get an abortion to make the problem go away but Michael says we need to get married instead.
    Sophie: It's all about what everyone else thinks. I'm not even sure if he's a Christian.
    Colin: Wow, I didn't realise it was that bad. How are you feeling about it?
    Sophie: In truth, I'm a bit scared of him.
    Colin: That makes sense. Are you reconsidering the relationship?
    Sophie: I don't know. I love him, but sometimes he pressures me into doing things that I don't want to do. And if I break up with him, I'm afraid of what he will do.
    Sophie: You know what, I will insist on the abortion and see what he says.
     [delay: 0.5s]
    Colin: Uh, Sophie, I'm very glad you're taking a stand against him.
    Colin: But an abortion isn't your only option.
    Colin: You could keep the baby and put it up for adoption.
    Sophie: B-but what would everyone think?
    Colin: It doesn't matter what they think. What's done is done, and what matters is to save the life of the baby.
    Colin: You can't just kill a baby to save yourself a little bit of embarrassment.
    Colin: There's lots of people who would love to adopt a baby but there aren't enough.
    Sophie: Thanks Colin, I'll think about it.

    Colin: Hopefully I've got some of the way to helping you understand your beliefs. I always try to refute my own beliefs to understand them better.
    Colin: It's frighteningly easy to think that you're always right, and discussing with more people can sometimes just reinforce this.
